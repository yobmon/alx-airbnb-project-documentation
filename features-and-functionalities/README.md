🏡 Airbnb Clone — Features & Functionalities

This project is a backend clone of Airbnb, designed to replicate the core features of the Airbnb platform using modern backend technologies.
It provides RESTful APIs for managing users, listings, bookings, reviews, and more — serving as the backbone for a full-stack Airbnb-like application.

🔑 Core Features
🧑‍💼 1. User Management

User registration, login, and secure authentication (JWT-based).

Role management: regular users vs. hosts/admins.

Profile management with personal details, avatar uploads, and account settings.

Password encryption and reset functionality.

🏠 2. Property Listings

Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings.

Each listing includes:

Title, description, price, amenities, address, and location data.

Photo uploads and image gallery support.

Searchable and filterable listings (e.g., by location, price range, dates, amenities).

📅 3. Booking System

Guests can book available listings for specific dates.

Prevents double bookings through availability checks.

Tracks booking status: pending, confirmed, or canceled.

Allows hosts to manage and view reservations on their listings.

💬 4. Reviews & Ratings

Guests can leave reviews and ratings after completed stays.

Average rating automatically calculated per listing.

Hosts can respond to guest feedback.

💸 5. Payments & Transactions (optional / configurable)

Integration-ready endpoints for payment gateways (e.g., Stripe or PayPal).

Price calculations with service fees, taxes, and booking totals.

Payment status tracking for completed or pending transactions.

🧰 Additional Functionalities
🌍 Search & Filtering

Search listings by destination, date range, price, and property type.

Pagination and sorting for performance and scalability.

🗺️ Geolocation & Maps Integration

Support for geocoded locations using APIs (e.g., Google Maps or Mapbox).

Enables users to browse properties visually on a map interface.

🔐 Security

JWT authentication for all protected endpoints.

Secure password hashing (bcrypt or similar).

Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.

📡 RESTful API Architecture

Follows REST standards for clean, consistent endpoints.

Supports CRUD operations for all entities (Users, Listings, Bookings, Reviews).

Easy integration with frontend clients (React, Next.js, or mobile apps).

🧪 Testing & Documentation

Unit and integration tests for critical services (e.g., authentication, bookings).

API documentation using Swagger / Postman Collections.

Example environment variables for configuration (.env.example).
