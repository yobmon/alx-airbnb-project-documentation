Project Requirements
📘 Overview

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Airbnb Clone Backend project.
It defines what the system should do, who will use it, and the key features and interactions that guide its design and development.

🎯 Project Objective

To design and build a backend system that replicates the core functionalities of Airbnb — enabling users to list properties, search for accommodations, make bookings, leave reviews, and manage user profiles — through a RESTful API.

👥 User Roles
Role	Description
Guest	User who searches, books, and reviews properties.
Host	User who lists and manages rental properties.
Admin	Oversees user accounts, listings, and reviews (future enhancement).
Payment System	External service for processing payments securely.
⚙️ Functional Requirements
1. User Management

Users can register and log in securely.

Passwords are encrypted and stored securely.

Users can update their profiles and account details.

JWT-based authentication for protected routes.

2. Property Listings

Hosts can create, update, and delete their listings.

Listings contain title, description, price, amenities, and photos.

Guests can view and search listings by filters (location, price, date, etc.).

3. Booking System

Guests can book available properties for specific dates.

The system prevents double bookings for the same property.

Booking status: pending, confirmed, or canceled.

Notifications are sent to both guest and host after booking.

4. Reviews & Ratings

Guests can leave reviews and star ratings after a completed stay.

Hosts can view feedback left on their properties.

Average rating is calculated per property.

5. Payments (Optional / Integration-Ready)

Integration with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe or PayPal).

System records payment status and booking transactions.

Failed payments cancel bookings automatically.

6. Search & Filtering

Guests can search by destination, check-in/check-out dates, and price range.

Results are paginated and sortable for efficiency.

🧠 Non-Functional Requirements
Category	Description
Performance	System should handle concurrent user requests efficiently.
Security	Use HTTPS, password hashing, and input validation.
Scalability	Support scaling horizontally with microservices or containers.
Availability	Target uptime of 99.9% for production deployment.
Maintainability	Codebase must follow modular, RESTful, and documented standards.
Data Integrity	Prevent duplicate bookings and maintain transaction consistency.
🧩 Derived Use Cases
ID	Use Case Name	Primary Actor	Goal
UC01	Register User	Guest	Create a new user account.
UC02	Create Listing	Host	Add a new property to be listed.
UC03	Book Property	Guest	Book a property for given dates.
UC04	Leave Review	Guest	Submit feedback after stay.
UC05	Manage Bookings	Host	View and manage property reservations.
🧾 User Stories Summary

As a guest, I want to search for available listings so that I can find a place to stay.

As a guest, I want to view property details so that I can make an informed decision.

As a guest, I want to book a property and make a payment so that I can confirm my stay.

As a host, I want to create and manage my listings so that guests can book them.

As a guest, I want to leave a review after my stay so that I can share my experience.

🧱 System Components
Component	Description
API Server	Handles all HTTP requests and routes.
Database	Stores user, listing, booking, and review data.
Authentication Service	Manages user sessions and tokens.
Payment Service	Processes external payments and handles callbacks.
Notification Service	Sends emails or messages on key events (bookings, cancellations).
🔐 Security Requirements

All sensitive data (passwords, tokens) must be encrypted.

Use JWT authentication for protected endpoints.

Implement input validation to prevent SQL/NoSQL injection and XSS attacks.

Ensure only authorized users can modify or delete their own resources.

🧪 Testing & Validation

Unit tests for core features (auth, listings, bookings).

Integration tests for API endpoints.

Manual testing via Postman or Swagger UI.

CI/CD pipelines to run tests before deployment.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Real-time chat between guests and hosts.

Advanced search filters (property type, instant booking, amenities).

Admin dashboard for monitoring and moderation.

Push/email notifications for booking updates.
